## IDP Project

This repository contains the source code for the Cambridge University Integrated Design 
Project team L211 2018, colloquially known as 'Almost Logical'.

The goal of this project was to design an automomous ground vehicle to complete a predesigned task
on a field in under 5 minutes. All of the software was run on an extremely old 'Balloon Board' that
was provided, through the library in the folder 1BRobot. The task for that session was to sort and 
deliver eggs of various colors and sizes in nests of 4 eggs. This repository contains the final software
used in the competition, which is a little messy as there was a lot of design work done in the last few
days (when some of the competition rules inexplicably changed). Most of the code is documented
using doxygen which was used for generating the design acceptance documentation and report documentation.
